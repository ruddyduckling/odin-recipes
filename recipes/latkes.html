            <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated onion</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>

            <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li> <br>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are an even thickness.</li> <br>
